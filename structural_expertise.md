# Structural Expertise
My Structural Expertise is focused on:

-	Consulting for Newbuildings, Conversions and LNG (or other alternative fuel) Retrofit;
-	Consulting and Plan Approval with validation of the basic & detail design on behind of Shipowners during building stage;
-	Feasibility Studies for major Conversions and LNG (or other alternative fuel) Retrofit;
-	Structural evaluation and Main Foundations design for Special Equipment integration on the vessels in operation and offshore units;
-	Special Welding Sequence for avoiding structural deformations during integration of the complex structure units (as LNG membrane Tanks) on the existing vessels;
-	Special NDT Documents for complex structures integration (as LNG membrane Tanks) on the existing vessels;
-	Special Docking Plans and Mounting Sequence for vessels major Conversions on Fixe or Floating Docks;
-	Structural Engineering (with all correspondent hydrodynamic and structural analysis) for mounting and operation of the Outboard- and Inboard Demountable Thrusters in- stalled on the FPSO vessels or other Offshore units;
-	Evaluation of the Stress concentrations, Vibrations and Fatigue risk on the new and existing Vessels- and Offshore Units structure (based on the correspondent Finite Element Analysis Reports) under the huge operation loads of the installed equipment.
