# Welcome!

### Dipl. Engineer and Naval Architect with long track record in Shipbuilding and Offshore Structures Design.

My Technical Knowledges base on reference to many projects for different types of Ships and Offshore Structures which have been successfully managed and designed with my essential contribution.
